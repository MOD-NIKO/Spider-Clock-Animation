# Spider Clock Animation

> A spider‑themed animated clock built with HTML, CSS, SVG and GSAP — watch the gears turn and hands move like a living spider-clock.

## 🔧 What is this

Spider Clock Animation is a creative web project that uses SVG graphics and the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library to render a fully animated clock. The design includes rotating cogs, a stylized spider‑like clock face, and smooth motion of hour, minute, and second hands — offering a unique take on traditional analog clocks using web technologies.
